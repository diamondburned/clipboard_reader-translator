# clipboard_reader-translator

####Reads out loud your clipboard, sends a notification and reads the original clipboard out loud.

The script automatically detects the language of the clipboard and translates (reads) them accordingly.

Requirements: `gawk` (3.1+), `notify-osd` (to send notifications) and `bash`

Script originally from: http://git.io/trans
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell
The script was *slightly* modified to remove formattings in order for Bash to not screw up.
